0. Custom Radio Button: Using scoreObject instead of popQuestions 

1. Persist choices between screens (e.g. if you go to next question and then back, the choices you made should still be selected)

2. Allow user to forward and backward between questions - Even when no choice is selected, the user should be able to go to the next question. (Choice should be saved as null) - This is to allow the user to skip questions and come back to them later.
